    description:"This is a project I did for fun when I was learning JavaScript, to help me better understand what I was learning on my own. This project is for the indecisive horror fan who wants an evening of scares but can't decide for themselves what it is that they want to watch. It allows you to pick from a master list of movies, add your own titles to the master list of movies, or make a smaller list to choose from if you have a few in mind! Useful for group setting too, where no one wants to decide or no one can agree. It could really be re-skinned for an any movie picker! I used this project to help me learn about local storage and while there was a lot of trial and error, I'm still very happy with how I got it to turn out."

    description:"This project is still a work in progress. I started it in celebration/in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness month that takes place in October. This site offers resources and perspective. Right now it is a personal site about my own experience with breast cancer, but I have hopes of expanding it for other to join in, and/or to make it into a companion app for cancer patients."

     description:"This project is still a work in progress. It was the final project in my bootcamp. The assignment was to create a CRUD app using React. These are the results so far of my work but I am still working on perfecting little pieces of it, and would like to add to it to create spme kind of profile. This project really pushed the limits of my knowledge when I had just been learning react for a couple weeks. It took a lot of trial and error. This project helped me understand forms in React and making them work the way that I want them to, and it forced me to learn to understand state better."

I wrote the code and designed the site and feel that it really shows my capabilities. I had a lot of fun putting this site together. I struggled creating the contact page but found and figured out Emailjs. It took some time to get it to work right but figuring it out was an exciting moment"
