            My name is Nichole. I’m a single working mom to the best little girl. 
            Having beat stage 3 breast cancer, I’m now looking to make my future what I want it to be. 
            There is no more time for self-doubt or fear. I've faced the worst of the worst and come out on top. 
            During treatment you have these moments where you are really forced to reflect on your life, what 
            you’ve done with it so far, and what you’ll do if you can make it through cancer alive. Facing your 
            own mortality really makes you think about a lot. I promised myself that I would beat cancer, and I 
            would take that opportunity as a fresh start to still be the person I wanted to be and do the things 
            that I wanted to do. I found programming and during treatment I taught myself using Udemy and Scrimba 
            courses. After treatment I attended the Promineo Tech Front End Developer Bootcamp to further learn 
            and understand and develop my new skillset. I have a fine art degree from BYU-Idaho where I placed most 
            of my emphasis on photography and graphic design. I feel like the things I learned from having cancer 
            are invaluable to the world around me and I feel like they will help me develop personally and 
            professionally in ways that others just can’t understand. I am really looking forward to combining 
            those sets of skills in the future. I’m excited to have a future, and to keep learning, growing and 
            developing. I find joy in being authentic and life is too short to not do what you love. I love spending
             time with my family and friends and enjoying my hobbies.
